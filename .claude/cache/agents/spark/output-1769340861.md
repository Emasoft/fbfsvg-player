# Quick Fix: Update CI/CD workflows for FBFSVGPlayer rename
Generated: $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")

## Change Made
- File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Lines: 113, 116, 119-121, 131, 147, 149, 362, 365, 371
- Change: Updated library and framework naming

## Verification
- Syntax check: PASS (YAML format preserved)
- Pattern followed: Consistent renaming across all references

## Files Modified
1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Updated library names and framework paths

## Detailed Changes

### Linux Library References
- `libsvgplayer.so` → `libfbfsvgplayer.so` (5 occurrences)
- `svgplayer.pc` → `fbfsvgplayer.pc` (pkg-config file)

### iOS Framework References  
- `SVGPlayer.xcframework` → `FBFSVGPlayer.xcframework` (3 occurrences)

### API Symbols (Unchanged)
- `SVGPlayer_Create`, `SVGPlayer_Destroy`, `SVGPlayer_LoadSVG` - Left unchanged as they are C API function names

## Other Workflow Files
- `release.yml` - No SDK path references found
- `regression-guard.yml` - No SDK path references found

## Notes
- API function symbols remain as `SVGPlayer_*` (part of stable C API)
- Only library filenames, framework names, and pkg-config files were renamed
- All changes are backward-compatible at the API level
