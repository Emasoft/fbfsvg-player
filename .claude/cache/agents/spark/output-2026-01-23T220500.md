# Quick Fix: Remove Unused Includes from Test Files
Generated: 2026-01-23T22:05:00

## Change Made

### File 1: `tests/test_macos_player.cpp`
- Line: 16
- Change: Removed `#include <cmath>` (unused - no math functions called)

### File 2: `tests/test_linux_player.cpp`
- Line: 15-16
- Change: Removed `#include <memory>` and `#include <sstream>` (unused - no smart pointers or string streams used)

### File 3: `tests/test_windows_player.cpp`
- Line: 14
- Change: Removed `#include <cmath>` (unused - no math functions called)
- Line: 30
- Change: Removed `#include "../shared/svg_player_api.h"` (unused - test only uses mock types, not the actual API)

## Verification
- Syntax check: N/A (header-only changes)
- Pattern followed: Standard include cleanup

## Files Modified
1. `/Users/emanuelesabetta/Code/SKIA-BUILD-ARM64/tests/test_macos_player.cpp` - Removed unused `<cmath>` include
2. `/Users/emanuelesabetta/Code/SKIA-BUILD-ARM64/tests/test_linux_player.cpp` - Removed unused `<memory>` and `<sstream>` includes
3. `/Users/emanuelesabetta/Code/SKIA-BUILD-ARM64/tests/test_windows_player.cpp` - Removed unused `<cmath>` and `svg_player_api.h` includes

## Notes
All edits completed successfully. The test files should compile without issues as the removed includes were not used anywhere in the code.
